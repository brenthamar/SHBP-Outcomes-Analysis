# SHBP-Outcomes-Analysis
Analyze SHBP health behavior risks data, and develop reporting results on change in risk and associated savings

Initial numbering on the different programs indicate the general step of the way that I went through to carry out the analysis
on the different health risk metrics that were part of the analysis. I start with the '0' program and then develop differnet program work
in each next program, 1,2,3, etc.   When consulting with internal account manager, sometimes I have to go back and change something in analysis.
I often add a letter, such as 'b' to program name to add a follow-up program.
